            <h1>Cloud Computing Conference</h1>
            <h2>Date of Conference: July 15-16 | Bronx NY | Virtual + Onsite</h2>
            <h3>About the computing Conference: </h3>
            <p>
                This is the first annual Cloud Computing Conference at Lehman College. The conference series will feature keynote talks, special 
                sessions, poster presentation, tutorials, workshops, and contributed papers.
            </p>

            <p> 
                The goal of the conference is to be a premier venue for researchers and industry practitioners to share new ideas, research results 
                and development experiences in various fields. This will be one of a kind in the Bronx.
            </p>

                Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, from applications to storage and processing power. Cloud computing 
                relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale. Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud 
                computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows 
                enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables 
                IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing the burst computing capability: 
                high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.
